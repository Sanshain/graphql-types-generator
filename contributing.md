- **Typing of mutation response data:** Currently, there is no provision for typing the results returned by mutations. The feature has left for last, 
since the author believes that the main purpose of mutations is updating server data instead of getting server data. Nevertheless, he believes 
that such a feature would be a good cherry on the cake.
- **Make rules as patterns** like `['\*id', 'id\*']` specifying start or end of field name
